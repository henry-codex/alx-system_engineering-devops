The Server

Positioned within a datacenter, a specialized structure housing numerous machines, the server depicted in the diagram can be either physical or virtual, represented as an instance of a physical server.
Equipped with a unique operating system, this server efficiently provides services to end users.
One Web Server

Installed on the server is an NGINX web server responsible for serving "static" web content (unchanging content delivered to users) using the HTTP protocol.
One Application Server

The primary function of the application server is to process web server requests and generate dynamic content based on the backend's business logic and application database.
One Database

The database's main role is to store application data.
Domain Name / Domain Name System (DNS)

The DNS plays a crucial role in translating the domain name record to its corresponding IP address.
The hosted website, www.foobar.com, is represented as an A record, resolving to the IPV4 address 8.8.8.8.
Issues with This Infrastructure

The server being a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
This infrastructure lacks a redundant server as a backup, leaving it susceptible to failure if the single server malfunctions. As a result, the application may crash.
Downtime During Maintenance
Performing maintenance activities, such as deploying new code, requires rebooting the server, causing a downtime period during which the server is unavailable for client functionalities.
Lack of Scalability
Due to its reliance on a single server, web server, and application server, this infrastructure is incapable of scaling efficiently to handle multiple requests. The absence of a load balancer further contributes to this limitation.
Protocol
The server utilizes the TCP/IP protocol to establish communication with the user's computer requesting access to the website.
