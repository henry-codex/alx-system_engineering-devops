Additional Elements

3 Firewalls: These firewalls are responsible for filtering network traffic both into and out of the machine, enhancing security and protecting the infrastructure from potential threats.
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS: This SSL certificate ensures that the traffic to and from www.foobar.com is encrypted, safeguarding it from interception and unauthorized access.
3 Monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services): The monitoring clients play a crucial role in tracking various metrics and ensuring the smooth operation of the system.
Monitoring Setup

The monitoring setup consists of a client that collects data and transmits it to the monitoring system.
The monitoring system is configured to:
i. Collect web server data, providing insights into the web servers' performance and health.
ii. Trigger an alert if the Query Per Second (QPS) metric exceeds acceptable levels, allowing prompt response to potential issues.
Problems

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted and vulnerable to potential attacks. It is essential to consider implementing end-to-end encryption for better security.
The dependency on a single MySQL server (The Master) capable of accepting writes poses a significant risk. If this server goes down, the application will lose the ability to write to the database, potentially leading to service disruptions.
Utilizing servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to maintenance problems. Performing maintenance on a server for a specific component may inadvertently affect other components sharing the same server.
Server uniformity may also be problematic as the consumption and resource demands may not grow uniformly across all components, potentially leading to imbalanced performance and resource allocation.
The load balancer, despite adding redundancy, remains a single point of failure. If the load balancer fails, the entire infrastructure could suffer downtime or become inaccessible to users. Implementing a redundant load balancer configuration could mitigate this issue.
